## Installation

1. Get `ruby`, `ruby-dev`, and `node` however you do that in your OS.
2. `gem install bundle` and `npm i -g gulp@^4.0.0`
3. `bundle install` and `npm i`
4. Get mad at native Ruby packages. Get mad at GitHub for liking Ruby. Repeat until `bundle` succeeds.
4. To use this you can:
    - `gulp watch` to incrementally build and sync changes in real time
    - `gulp serve` to painfuly rebuild all changes and view them after refreshing
    - `gulp build` to build your website into the `_site` directory
