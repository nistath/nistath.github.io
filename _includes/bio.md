# Hello!

I am Nick â€” a maker, technology enthusiast, and an EECS student at MIT.

I am actively involved in MIT Motorsports, a team that annually builds an electric racecar and competes in Formula SAE.

In the past, I have built several cool projects, usually for the fun of it.
You can read more about them in my [portfolio](/portfolio) or while stalking me on [GitHub](github.com/nistath).

I enjoy collaboratively architecting large systems, optimizing workflow through better tooling, and creating elegant frameworks that solve problems better.

Enough about my ramblings; feel free to email me with any questions or propositions you have.

### Have a nice day!
